##Bisection Search
##

##In this problem, you'll create a program that guesses a secret number!
##The program works as follows: you (the user) thinks of an integer between 0 (inclusive) and 100 (not inclusive). 
##The computer makes guesses, and you give it input - is its guess too high or too low? Using bisection search, the computer 
##will guess the user's secret number!

print("Please think of a number between 0 and 100!")
low=0
high=100
guessed=False
while not guessed:
    print("Is your secret number " + str((high+low)/2) + "?")
    x=raw_input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")
    while x in ["l","h","c"]:
        if x=="l":
            low=(high+low)/2
            break
        elif x=="h":
            high=(high+low)/2
            break
        elif x=="c":
            print("Game over. Your secret number was: "+ str((high+low)/2))
            guessed=True
            break
    else:
        print("Sorry, I did not understand your input.")
        continue
        #print("Is your secret number"+ str((high+low)/2) + "?")
        #x=raw_input("Enter 'h' to indicate the guess is too high. Enter 'l' to indicate the guess is too low. Enter 'c' to indicate I guessed correctly.")

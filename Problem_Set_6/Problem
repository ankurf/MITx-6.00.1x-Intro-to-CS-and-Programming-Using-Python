##Cipher text Message and Decrypt Story
##

Encryption is the process of obscuring information to make it unreadable without special knowledge. 
For centuries, people have devised schemes to encrypt messages - some better than others - but the advent of the computer and 
the Internet revolutionized the field. These days, it's hard not to encounter some sort of encryption, whether you are buying 
something online or logging into a shared computer system. Encryption lets you share information with other trusted people, 
without fear of disclosure.

A cipher is an algorithm for performing encryption (and the reverse, decryption). The original information is called plaintext. 
After it is encrypted, it is called ciphertext. The ciphertext message contains all the information of the plaintext message, but 
it is not in a format readable by a human or computer without the proper mechanism to decrypt it; it should resemble random gibberish 
to those for whom it is not intended.

A cipher usually depends on a piece of auxiliary information, called a key. The key is incorporated into the encryption process; 
the same plaintext encrypted with two different keys should have two different ciphertexts. Without the key, it should be difficult 
to decrypt the resulting ciphertext into readable plaintext.

This assignment will deal with a well-known (though not very secure) encryption method called the Caesar cipher. 
Some vcabulary to get you started on this problem:

Encryption - the process of obscuring or encoding messages to make them unreadable until they are decrypted
Decryption - making encrypted messages readable again by decoding them
Cipher - algorithm for performing encryption and decryption
Plaintext - the original message
Ciphertext - the encrypted message. Note: a ciphertext still contains all of the original message information, 
even if it looks like gibberish.
